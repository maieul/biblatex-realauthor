\section{Introduction}

The standard biblatex fields allow to describe the author of a work, with the so called \bibfield{authors} field. However, some works are published without name, or with pseudonyme, but the scholars know the real author. This package adds a new field \bibfield{realauthor}, to specify the knew real author.

\section{Basic use}

\subsection{The .bib file}
Basically, you just have to add the real author name in the field \bibfield{realauthor}, like in the two following examples: 

\inputminted{tex}{example.bib}

\subsection{Loading of the \biblatex package}

When loading the \biblatex package, use the \namebibstyle{realauthor}  bibstyle, which is based on the \namebibstyle{verbose} bibstyle:

\begin{minted}{latex}
\usepackage[citestyle=verbose,bibstyle=realauthor]{biblatex}
\end{minted}

Not that the package patches \verb+author+ and \verb+author/editor+others/translator+others+ macro. If you redefine them, don't forget the patches\footnote{We suppose that, if you redefine them, you could understand the packages.}.

\subsection{Example of result}

By default, the real author name is printed in brackets, with an equal, between fine nonbreak spaces,  when a pseudonym is also use:
\begin{quotation}
\cite{LeClerc1686}

\cite{Simon1686}
\end{quotation}



This package, since version 2.0.0, declares  the \bibfield{realauthor} name as the \bibfield{labelname}, if a \bibfield{author} name is not defined.

That implies this field is use for:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Sorting.
  \item \emph{ibid} / \emph{op. cit} abreviation.
\end{itemize}

Note that this field is not affected by \verb+useauthor+ option.

\subsection{Sorting}\label{sorting}

The default sorting schemes \verb+nty+ is problematic, because it doesn't consider the \bibfield{realauthor} field  as a name. That is why the package provides two sorting scheme:

\begin{itemize}
   \item  \verb|anonymous|, which  but considers the \bibfield{realauthor} field to sort list by authors' name. If an entry has both \bibfield{realauthor} and \bibfield{author}, only the \bibfield{author} field we be used.
  \item  \verb|anonymous+realauthor|, which push the anonymous texts at the begininng of the list (as the \verb+anonymous+ sorting of the \emph{biblatex-anonymous+} package), but considers the \bibfield{realauthor} field to sort list by authors' name (as the \verb+realauthor+ sorting).
  
  See the example file to have an illustration.
\section{Customization}

You can redefine the \cmd{mkrealauthor} command to change the way the real author name is printed. Default value is:

\begin{minted}{tex}
\newcommand{\mkrealauthor}[1]{\mkbibbrackets{#1}}
\end{minted}

You can also redefine the \cmd{realauthorequalsign} command to change the sign before the real author name when a pseudonym is also used. Default value is:

\begin{minted}{tex}
\newcommand{\realauthorequalsign}{\addnbthinspace=\addnbthinspace}
\end{minted}

For more customization, you have to redefine the macros defined in \file{realauthor.bbx}.



\section{Use with biblatex-manuscripts-philology}

To use this package with the features of \verb+biblatex-manuscripts-philology+, you must use the package \verb+biblatex-multiple-dm+.
